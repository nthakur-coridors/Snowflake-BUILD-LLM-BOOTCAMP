What toys would you like to include in your holiday wish list?\\ncaller: Hmm, I'm not sure yet. I was thinking about getting the Jurassic World dinosaur for my son.\\nfrosty: The Jurassic World Dominion Super Colossal Giganotosaurus is an excellent choice! Would you like some more suggestions based on your son's interests?\\ncaller: Yeah, sure!\\nfrosty: How about the Transformers Rise of the Beasts Beast-Mode Bumblebee? It's perfect for kids who love action and adventure.\\ncaller: Hmm, that sounds interesting. I think he'd love that. Let's add that to the list.\\nfrosty: Alright! What do you enjoy most about this time of the year, Jake?\\ncaller: I love spending time with my family, exchanging gifts, and enjoying nice meals together.\\nfrosty: That's the best part about the holidays! Do you have a favorite pastime or hobby?\\ncaller: I'm a big fan of snowboarding during the winter months. Love hitting the slopes on weekends.\\nfrosty: Sounds like a thrilling adventure! So, I have the Transformers Rise of the Beasts Beast-Mode Bumblebee on your wish list. Is there anything else you'd like to add?\\ncaller: Actually, let's add that Jurassic World dinosaur too. He likes both dinosaurs and Transformers, so I'm sure he'll be happy with either one.\\nfrosty: Perfect! So the Jurassic World Dominion Super Colossal Giganotosaurus will also be added to your list. Have a fantastic holiday season, Jake! Goodbye!\\ncaller: Thanks, Frosty! You too! Goodbye!\"   \n",

Now, let's talk about your grandkids' holiday wish list. What items are you considering?\\ncaller: I was thinking about getting them the bluey playhouse and the fingerlings monkey, but I'm open to other suggestions.\\nfrosty: The Bluey Ultimate Lights and Sounds playhouse and the Fingerlings are both popular choices for kids! If you're looking for an interactive pet, how about the Little Live Pets Mama Surprise or the Bitzee interactive pet?\\ncaller: Oh, those sound interesting! Can you tell me more about the Little Live Pets Mama Surprise?\\nfrosty: Absolutely! The Little Live Pets Mama Surprise is an adorable interactive pet with baby surprises concealed inside. Kids will love discovering the baby animals and caring for them, encouraging nurturing play.\\ncaller: That's perfect! Let's add that to the list instead of the fingerlings monkey.\\nfrosty: Great! So, we have the Bluey Ultimate Lights and Sounds playhouse and the Little Live Pets Mama Surprise on your holiday wish list. Is that correct?\\ncaller: Yes, that's correct.

    "Fine-tuning is one form of model training. We start training from a pre-trained model and adjust a set of model parameters to better solve for a concrete task based on task specific data. Today we are going to fine-tune 7B Llama 2 model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)--which is a parameter efficient way of fine-tuning LLM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of adjusting all the ~7B parameters, LoRA allows us to adjust only a percent of model weights--which can save compute and memory resources dramatically. For this lab, we will fine-tune our model using LoRA on a single A10 GPU. This will demostrate how good the inference can be on fine-tuned models even with limited compute.\n",
